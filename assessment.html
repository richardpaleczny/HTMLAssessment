  <h2>TEXT</h2>
  <p><strong>Painting</strong> should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Use what happens naturally, don't fight it. You've got to learn to fight the temptation to resist these things. Just let them happen. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. What the devil. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. See there how easy that is.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <em><strong>We</strong>
      don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? At home you have unlimited time. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. In your world you can create anything you desire. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there.

  <p><strong>In</strong> this world, everything can be happy. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Just make a decision and let it go. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license.</p>
